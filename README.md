This app was created to allow users to select from a large list of countries via a drop down and have it display the up to the minute data on that countries total number of Covid-19 cases and the associated number of those who unfortunately have been taken from us to this horrible pandemic. I am pulling in from an API that scrapes official government data to give up to date total numbers by country.
